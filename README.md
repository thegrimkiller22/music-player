Sure, here's a README file for the Python MP3 Music Player:

# Python MP3 Music Player

This is a simple MP3 music player built using Python's `pygame` library for audio playback and `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- Play, pause, stop, resume, and navigate between songs.
- Add songs to the playlist from your local machine.
- Remove songs from the playlist.
- Control the volume using the volume slider.
- Display the currently playing song's name.
- Show the status of the player (Playing, Paused, Stopped).
- Enable keyboard shortcuts for controlling playback (Spacebar for play/pause, Left/Right arrow keys for previous/next).
- Automatically play the next song when the current song ends.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library (to install, run `pip install pygame`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and the `pygame` library installed.
3. Add your MP3 songs to the "Music" folder within the project directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
5. Run the Python script `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

6. The music player GUI window will appear, showing the list of available songs in the "Music" folder.
7. Use the buttons to control playback (Play, Pause, Stop, Resume, Prev, Next).
8. Use the volume slider to adjust the volume level.
9. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for playback control (Spacebar for play/pause, Left/Right arrow keys for previous/next).

## Note

- Only MP3 files are supported for playback.
- The volume slider allows you to set the volume from 0 to 100, with a precision of one decimal point.

## Acknowledgments
